Data of whole exome sequencing

Ectopic Posterior Pituitary (EPP) Whole Exome Sequencing Data Introduction Ectopic posterior pituitary (EPP) is a rare congenital abnormality, sometimes associated with other midline defects, such as pituitary stalk interruption syndrome (PSIS). PSIS involves a thin or absent pituitary stalk and anterior pituitary hypoplasia combined with EPP. While most cases of EPP are sporadic, there are few reports of familial occurrences, and many cases of congenital hypopituitarism (CH) remain unsolved.

Objective This study's objective is to search for candidate genes associated with EPP. To achieve this, we performed trio-based whole-exome sequencing (WES) on patients diagnosed with EPP, including two familial cases.

Methods We conducted two distinct analyses using trio-based WES:

Gene Search: We investigated previously described genes associated with pituitary development. Exome Analysis: We explored the entire exome for variants inherited in a pattern consistent with a monogenic etiology. Repository Contents Data/: Contains raw sequencing data files (FASTQ, BAM, VCF). Metadata/: Includes detailed information about the samples, sequencing methods, and clinical data. Documentation/: Contains the README file, detailed descriptions, and instructions on how to use the data. Scripts/: Includes scripts and tools used for data analysis. Usage Please refer to the Usage Instructions for detailed data access and analysis steps.
